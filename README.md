## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was able to practice using the CSS flexbox in this project. It was quite fascinating. For a component like this, designing it makes me to be familiar with various concepts and properties in Flexbox. Any website I open now, I try to visualize it with flexboxðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž.

### Continued development

I will like to learn more about media queries because I received a feedback on the previous project that it doesn't fit well on desktop.
